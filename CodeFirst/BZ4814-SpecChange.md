## Summary of the change

Introduce a Random Number Generator (RNG) PPI to provide a standard binary interface for a platform PEIM to provide
RNG services to other PEIMs. Similar to the RNG Protocol defined in the UEFI 2.10 Specification, the RNG PPI returns
random numbers and can serve as an entropy source for seeding other cryptographic services. The RNG PPI interface is
proposed to use the same interface as the protocol for API consistency and implementation reuse.

## Benefits of the change

Security has evolved in modern firmware implementations to necessitate supporting technologies that depend on strong
entropy sources such as key derivation functions, signature schemes, initialization vectors, and other cryptographic
services. More content is expected to be secure at rest, in transit, and in use. Interaction with microcontrollers
and peripherals is increasingly growing and demanding secure communication between components. In addition, random
numbers strengthen recent security mitigations being adopted in PEI phase modules such as dynamically generated stack
cookie values.

At the same time, secure software supply chain practices are gaining adoption with an emphasis on software inventory
management and software bill of materials (SBOM) generation. This lends to more binary distribution alongside an
accompanying SBOM especially for security sensitive components such as the platform RNG provider. RNG technologies
also vary across architecture, vendor, and computing segments. A platform may need to provide RNG services in PEI
across binary boundaries and that can be accomplished with the RNG PPI.

## Impact of the change

Because this change is introducing an entirely new API, there will not be any impact on existing implementations. An
instance of the `RngLib` will be provided that instead of statically linking RNG code directly will locate and use the
RNG PPI. As is always the case for dynamic interfaces like PPIs, platform integrators will need to account for
dependencies between the PEIM that produces the RNG PPI and the PEIMs that consume it.

## Detailed description of the change [normative updates]

### Specification Changes

In PI Specification v1.9: Vol. 1, "Optioanl Additional PPIs", a new section would be introduced to define the RNG
PPI.

If the RNG PPI were fully defined duplicating information the RNG Protocol definition in the UEFI Specification,
it may be presented as shown below. **Feedback is welcome on the preferred way to present the RNG PPI definition
details with respect to the UEFI Specification.**

#### Random Number Generator PPI

This section defines the Random Number Generator (RNG) PPI. This PPI is used to provide random numbers for use in
PEI modules, or as an entropy source for seeding other random number generators. Consumers of the PPI can query
information about the RNG algorithms supported by the driver, and request random numbers from the driver.

When a Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) is used on the output of a (raw) entropy source, its security level
must be at least 256 bits.

The RNG PPI interface is the same as the RNG Protocol interface defined in the UEFI Specification.

##### RNG_PPI

**Summary**

This PPI provides standard RNG functions. It can be used to provide random bits for use in applications, or
entropy for seeding other random number generators.

**GUID**

```c
#define RNG_PPI_GUID \
{ 0xeaed0a7e, 0x1a70, 0x4c2b,\
  {0x85, 0x58, 0x37, 0x17, 0x74, 0x56, 0xd8, 0x06}}
```

**PPI Structure**

```c
typedef struct _RNG_PPI {
  EFI_RNG_GET_INFO            GetInfo
  EFI_RNG_GET_RNG             GetRNG;
}  RNG_PPI;
```

**Parameters**

`GetInfo`
Returns information about the random number generation implementation.

`GetRNG`
Returns the next set of random numbers.

**Description**

This PPI allows retrieval of RNG values from another PEIM. The *GetInfo* service returns information about the RNG
algorithms the driver supports. The *GetRNG* service creates a RNG value using an (optionally specified) RNG algorithm.

###### RNG_PPI.GetInfo

**Summary**

Returns information about the random number generation implementation.

**Prototype**

```c
typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI *EFI_RNG_GET_INFO) (
  IN RNG_PPI                 *This,
  IN OUT UINTN                   *RNGAlgorithmListSize,
  OUT EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM          *RNGAlgorithmList
);
```

**Parameters**

`This`

A pointer to the *RNG_PPI* instance.

`RNGAlgorithmListSize`

On input, the size in bytes of *RNGAlgorithmList.* On output with a return code of *EFI_SUCCESS,* the size in bytes of
the data returned in *RNGAlgorithmList.*

On output with a return code of *EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL,* the size of *RNGAlgorithmList* required to obtain the list.

`RNGAlgorithmList`

A caller-allocated memory buffer filled by the driver with one *EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM* element for each supported RNG
algorithm. The list must not change across multiple calls to the same driver. The first algorithm in the list is the
default algorithm for the driver.

**Description**

This function returns information about supported RNG algorithms.

A driver implementing the RNG PPI need not support more than one RNG algorithm, but shall support a minimum of one
RNG algorithm.

##### EFI RNG Algorithm Definitions

**Summary**

This sub-section provides *EFI_GUID* values for a selection of *RNG_PPI* algorithms. The algorithms listed are
optional, not meant to be exhaustive and may be augmented by vendors or other industry standards.

The "raw" algorithm, when supported, is intended to provide entropy directly from the source, without it going through
some deterministic random bit generator. These algorithms are defined in the *UEFI Specification* and shown in
"Related Definitions" below.

### Code Changes

- Introduce a new module `RngPei` in `SecurityPkg` that produces the `RNG_PPI` interface.
  - Similar to `RngDxe`, this module will consume an instance of `RngLib` to provide the actual RNG services.
  - This should allow significant code reuse for platforms already using that `RngLib` instance today in PEI.
- Introduce a new `RngLib` library instance called `PeiRngLib` in `MdePkg` that locates and uses `RNG_PPI`.
  - As platforms adopt the RNG PPI, they should link the `RngLib` instance that implements RNG to `RngPei` and
    this instance to all other PEIMs (similar in DXE usage today).
- `Rng.h` will be introduced in `MdePkg/Include/Ppi` to define the `RNG_PPI` interface. It will use the same
  definitions from `MdePkg/Include/Protocol/Rng.h`.
